Profile, Ideas, and Resources


Hey All, 

My name is Asia Mai. I reside in Ohio. I was also born and raised here. Over the last 5 years, not only have I worked in food and beverage, but I've worked as a dance instructor and choreographer for various dance studios.  In 2016, I was searching for a career path that I could bring my creativity and zeal for problem solving to. I've now been studying programming and web developement at Cuyahoga Community College.
